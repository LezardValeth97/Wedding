			"description": "Thanh Thủy, armed with a love for literature and a talent for spotting \"great potential\", dives into the world of HR.

		"heading": "When We First Met",
		"paragraph1": "We first crossed paths in March 2022, not through a charming university gathering, but through an ignored recruitment email. Quốc Việt, true to his absent-minded nature, completely missed Thanh Thủy's interview invitation, leaving her with the worst first impression possible. Months later, in July, fate intervened when Quốc Việt officially joined USTH as a lecturer. It was then, while submitting paperwork, that he experienced love at first sight—unfortunately, without many chances to actually talk to her.",
		"paragraph2": "Everything changed in December 2023 during a team-building trip, where a captured moment of Thanh Thủy being pulled away from Quốc Việt set things in motion. Conversations grew deeper, and on a rainy January night in 2024, after a hilariously awkward confession that went unheard, Quốc Việt gathered his courage, turned back, and properly declared his feelings in Nghĩa Đô Park. That night, their story truly began.",
		"paragraph3": "Now, we're excited to start this new chapter together, surrounded by our dearest family and friends. We can't wait to celebrate this special day with all of you!",
